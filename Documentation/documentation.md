# Documentation
Note: Will be deleted once other documents have been seperated.

Jonathan: I believe we just have the statement of intent to do. Going to bed now, will finish tomorrow.

Sophia: Any other additional changes to the gantt chart or diagrams will be appreciated because I think there isn't enough information, but if there are no other additional changes to be made then that is fine as well. A little more detail in the logbook is suggested but not required :)
