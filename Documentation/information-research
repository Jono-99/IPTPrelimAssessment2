## Ovis
Ovis is a unique AI-powered suitcase that is designed to follow the owner through any location. It includes computer vision technology, Visual Simultaneous Location And Mapping (VSLAM), and artificial neural network algorithms developed by ForwardX to have the ability to continuously follow along beside the user. Ovis is self-acclaimed to be unique as it is able to identify and “see” objects that a human sees to easily avoid objects. Its ability to avoid objects is based on self-driving technology and its prediction algorithms. Another part of why it seems very convenient is its removable battery and its included USB ports. The removable battery of the Ovis suitcase allows ease of access through airport security and the USB ports allow the suitcase to be easily charged to have less opportunities to switch to manual mode. Ovis is capable of sensing its environment without human input with a camera and other sensory machinery incorporated into Ovis. 
	Ovis was first idealised in November 2015 and soon raised 1 million USD in an angel round funding in December 2016. As Ovis began its main development, the team size grew to create prototypes and to include its unique self-driving technology in 2017. Ovis continued to grow with more public exposure due to a convention in January 2018 and its launch of a crowdfunding campaign in May 2018. With over 100+ team members and more than 1 million USD raised, Ovis is set to deliver its final products around the world in December 2018.
