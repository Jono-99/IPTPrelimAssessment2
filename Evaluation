# Evaluation
As a group, we have achieved in creating a website, a pamphlet and an infographic that suited the user’s requests. The user’s requirements were not strict and specific which allowed our group to have our own creative take on the products. With this freedom, the development stage was not difficult because the members were not constricted to any requirement. This stage was still quite difficult for some members due to the lack of guidelines and the absence of criticism from the users. Another difficulty in the development stage is the lack of communication among the members, but this is due to them working on each of their assigned work. 

The pamphlet and infographic work did not follow the gantt chart well because there were new ideas formed and ideas that did not work when beginning to structure these products. The members that were working on the website did an excellent job on keeping up with their tasks despite the amount of work that is required in website development. 

With this in mind, the final products were fantastic even with the lack of communication in the first few weeks. We believe that communicating with each other with more group discussions would have been efficient in creating relationships with one another to become comfortable enough to criticise and suggest ideas that would have made better products.
