# IPTPrelimAssessment2
Are we done?

Sophia: I typed some of the group evaluation, hopefully it isn't so bad because I didn't know what to write :D

Jonathan: It was good, I added one more sentence, but I agreed with it pretty much, and it is only worth something like 1.25 marks, so I think you have written enough.
